# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

In this project, we will extract financial data like historical data share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks.

After collecting data, we will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla and GameStop.

This project is the requirement to accomplish Python Project for Data Science course by IBM from Coursera.
